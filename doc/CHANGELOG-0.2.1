24/05/2010: Version 0.2.1
    - Around 8% computing time improvement in the minimax algorithm (tested
      in a 32-bit centrino duo processor)
    - New version of the old NK points based heuristic
    - Experimental "Amount of pieces" heuristic
    - Changes to the configuration are applied just after closing the config
      dialog instead of waiting for the next turn as it happened in the 
      previous version. If, for example, the user sets the search tree depth
      to a big value and computing is taking too long, the config dialog
      can be opened again, settings changed and changes applied instantly
    - Improved progress bar handling
    - Accelerators for New and Quit options in the Game menu
    - Icons are loaded correctly in window platform

13/05/2010: Version 0.2.0
    - Nucleation points are drawn on the board (if user selects the suitable
      option in the menu) using player's colour. Shared nucleation points 
      are black.
    - Current player's forbidden areas can also be shown selecting the 
      "show forbidden area" option in the menu
    - App can be set up to play human vs human, human vs computer and 
      computer vs computer games
    - Computer and human players can be selected to play as player1 or
      player2 in any kind of game
    - Settings of a game can be edited at all times through the preferences
      menu (in settings) except for starting coordinates, which can be edited
      either when a new game is launched or if no pieces have been put down on 
      the board
    - Type of heuristic (evaluation function) for computer players can 
      be edited through both the preferences dialog and when a new game is
      launched. 3 types of heuristic have been included in this release: 
      "NK weighted", "simple" and "random"
    - Piece edition improved for those pieces with only one possible
      configuration
    - Application is able to cancel a computing operation for a new game
      to start. In previous versions cancelling the current computing operation
      was only enabled when the human user wanted to close the application (new
      games had to wait until the worker thread had finished its calculations)
    - libglade dependency removed. Gtkbuilder is used instead
    - Executable in windows has reduced its size around 50%. Released zipped
      binary for windows has been also reduced around 30%
    - Fixed possible deadlock that might have occurred when the game was about
      to finish
    - Player handling through Game1v1 interface simplified in source code

24/04/2010: Version 0.1.6
    - Computer's latest piece deployed glows so human user can easily notice
      what was the latest move
    - App kills itself instead of hunging up when unexpected state occurs 
      if cumputing thread is busy
    - Progress bar and moves calculated by worker thread are totally 
      thread-safe now
    - Command line options are properly handled. Blockem can load a game,
      process the next move and print it out in console with no GUI

16/04/2010: Version 0.1.5
    - Minmax has been fixed. It was faulty because pieces weren't being 
      rotated once they were mirrored during the AI calculations.
    - Editing piece drawing area contains 4 buttons, so the user can rotate
      to the left and right and mirror over the X and Y axis.
    - Game1v1 test code fixed
    - Game->New menu restarts the user's stopwatch even if there's no pieces
      on the board

09/04/2010: Version 0.1.4
    - Added stopwatch to measure how long computer and human take to move
    - Computer player doesn't process the next move so hard if it already 
      managed to block completely the human user (it was a bit tedious to wait
      before)
    - Added a bit of randomness to the starting move when the computer player
      starts. What is life without randomness after all?
    - Progress bar in the status bar is fully functional
    - Removed extra command line window when running in the windows platform
    - Board drawing area is now handling its own events. GUI code has been
      improved a lot throughout the last couple of versions

04/04/2010: Version 0.1.3
    - Computer's pieces left are shown on the right side of the board
    - Current score is shown on the status bar at all times
    - Correct version shown on the AboutDialog when help->About is pressed
    - Editing piece area shows a circle sorrounding the selected piece
    - More refactoring done on the GUI code

26/03/2010: Version 0.1.2
    - The ugly buttons that used to represent pieces have been changed by 
      real (and beautiful) pieces.
    - Ghost pieces on the board were kept painted even when the mouse
      pointer had left the board drawing area. That has been fixed.
    - Icon added to the executable file in the windows version. 
    - Part of the gui code has been refactored (there's a lot of work left)

19/03/2010: Version 0.1.1
    - pthread dependecy has been moved to gthread.
    - Port to windows done. Code compiles in both linux and windows.
    - Unhandled menus in GUI are now blurred so the user can't select them.

04/02/2010: Version 0.1.0
    - This is the first release of this project.
    - At the moment it contains a fully functional 1vs1 game based on the 
      board game blokus (http://blokus.com).
    - 1vs1 means man versus computer, where the computer moves are calculated
      by a simple (and a bit foolish) heuristic.
    - It can be compiled and installed using the well-known autotools.
    - There's still a long way to walk on this project. Have a look at the
      document TODO for a small snapshot of it.
