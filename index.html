        <p>          
          This release has solved a few bugs found in previous versions. A new <b>4-players</b> mode has been also added to allow 4 human beings to play against each other (no <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> available yet).

        <h1>The project</h1>
        <h2>But what is it good for?</h2>
        
		<p>
		  <b>Blockem</b> is an <a href="doc/COPYING">open source</a> clone of the board strategy game <a href="http://www.blokus.com">blokus</a>.  
		  It is available for Unix-like systems and Windows and it is written in C++/<a href="http://www.gtkmm.org/">GTKmm</a> (the C++ wrapper of <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a>)
		</p>
        
        <p>
          This project features:
          <ul>
            <li>
              A <b>2-player mode</b> (duo game), that can be played against the computer or between two human beings.
              Several types of <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> are available when playing against the computer, 
              all of them based on the <b>minimax algorithm</b>.
            </li>
            <li>A <b>Single-player</b> (solo) game, where you allocate all the pieces on the board. Starting position and size of the board are completely customizable.</li>
            <li>A <b>4-players mode</b>, where all players are human. Starting position and size of the board are completely customizable too.</li>
            <li>
              A <b>challenge</b> mode. Basically a challenge describes a <b>board</b> (size and free squares) and a player -<b>challenger</b>- (set of pieces available plus starting position). A challenge is achieved when the challenger places all his/her pieces on the board.
            </li>
            <li>Blockem is available in two different languages: <b>English</b> and <b>Spanish</b>. I won't let go this chance to ask for help: If you are interested in translating it into your own language please visit the <a href="involved.html">get involved</a> page to learn more.</li>
            <li>Easily expandable mechanism to <b>add new heuristics</b> for developers. (read more about this <a href="devel.html#ai">here</a>).</li>
            <li>Duo games can be set up between different <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym>s so that it can be used to compare heuristics.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
		  
        <p>
          <a href="http://stallman.org/">Richard Stallman</a> would be glad to know that <b>blockem</b> is <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">free software</a> released under GNU GPL v3.

        <a name="rules"></a>

        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <h2>Any game needs a set of rules</h2>

        <p>
          In block'em you've got <b>21 pieces</b> to put down on the board (which are a set of all the possible free <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyomino">polyominoes</a> from 1 to 5 squares). Basically you will have to put down as many pieces as possible while <b>preventing your opponent</b> from doing the same. There are 3 basic rules to place pieces on the board:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
          <li><span>In 1vs1 games the first piece played of each color is placed 5 squares far from one of the board's four corners. The opponent starts 5 squares far from the opposite corner.
            <ul>
              <li>In 4 players games the first piece played of each color is placed in one of the board's four corners.</li>
            </ul>
          </span></li>
          <li><span>Each new piece played must be placed so that it touches at least one piece of the same color, with only corner-to-corner contact allowed. (Edges cannot touch).</span></li>
          <li><span>When a player cannot place a piece, he or she passes, and play continues as normal. The game ends when no one can place a piece.</span></li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
          This is an example of how pieces have to be put down on the board. In this particular 4 players game, 3 of the players were able to deploy all their pieces, while the remaining one ended up with 7 pieces left (28 squares in total).
        </p>

        <h1>A hint of history</h1>
        <h2>History is something that happens to other people</h2>

        <p>          
          Blockem is the result of <i>a bit</i> of a <b>obsession</b> I have developed since I first discovered blokus back in 2008. In those days an idea crossed over our (my and my workmates') heads, create 
          a smart blokus player to be used in one of the several blokus games we used to play whenever the 4th player was missing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Later on, once the project was started, we realised a smart blokus player in a 4 player game is, firstly, much more complicated to develop, and secondly, much harder to prove to be smart, due to the nature of the 4-players blokus game. 
          If you ever played a blokus game I am sure you have noticed 4-players blokus is not a fully strategical game, but more of a psychological one, since you can easily get ganged up by the other 3 players, isn't it James?
        </p>
        
        <p>
          The project's aim changed then, and its full purpose was to try to create a computer player driven by <acronym title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</acronym> to play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blokus#Blokus_Duo.2FTravel_Blokus">duo</a> games against a computer. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          That was the beginning, but since then Block'em has <a href="#intro">evolved</a> into something bigger and bigger by each version released...
